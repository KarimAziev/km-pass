;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides additional commands for managing password store (pass)
;; entries in Emacs.

;; It includes commands for copying passwords, usernames, OTP
;; tokens, and other fields, as well as generating, renaming, and deleting
;; entries.

;; The package also supports appending OTP tokens from images and URIs,
;; and includes a transient menu for easy access to these commands.

;;; Main commands

;; M-x `km-pass-transient' - A transient menu for managing password store (pass) entries
;; M-x `km-pass-mode-transient' - A transient menu for `pass-mode'.

Each element in the list is a string that specifies a field name to be searched
for within the password entry data. The functions `km-pass-copy-username' and
`km-pass-get-user' use this list to determine which fields to check when looking
for a username or user identification.

To customize the list, add or remove strings corresponding to the field names
that should be considered as containing user identification information. The
order of the strings in the list determines the priority of the fields during
the search."

  "Actions for password-store entries with conditional display.

A list of actions that can be performed on password-store entries. Each action
is a list with the following elements:

1. A character, which is the key to trigger the action.
2. A string, which is the description of the action.
3. A function or a symbol that will be called when the action is triggered.
4. An optional property list that can contain `:if' or `:if-not' followed by a
function or a symbol. The action will only be available if the specified
condition is met.

The default actions include copying the password, OTP token, username, other
field values, editing, deleting, adding, renaming, and generating new passwords
for entries.

Each action's availability can be conditionally determined by the presence of
certain fields in the entry, such as a secret, OTP, or username.

To use an action, invoke the function that handles the execution of actions on
password-store entries, passing the desired entry as an argument. The function
will present a list of available actions based on the conditions specified in
the property list. Selecting an action will execute the associated function or
symbol."
